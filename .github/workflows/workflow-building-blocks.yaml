on:
  push:
    branches: # what if you want to blanket do action on push regardless of branch?
      - main #insert branches you want to insert here
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
    paths: #just like branches can be a filter, so can the path within repo
      - '.github/**' #pull requests with any changes within `.github` directory & sub-directories will trigger
  workflow_dispatch: #another type of trigger, allows triggering workflow manually with some inputs we specify below
    inputs:
      outputValue:
        description: 'Value to output'
        required: false
        default: 'hello world'
  repository_dispatch: #trigger -> allows us to run workflow by making API call to github
    types: [hello_world] #why is this in square brackets??
  schedule: #eg: "i want my workflow to run at X time a specific day/everyday")
    - cron: "1 * * * *" #is there a difference in single quotes vs double quotes for github actions?

permissions:
  pull-requests: write #giving action express persission to also write

#the actual tasks that will be performed
#NOTE: each job is completely independent from one another -> can be run on different machines
jobs: 
  #first job
  hello-world:
    #more on runners: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest #can also use windows or mac latest for github hosted runners (though we can do self hosted runners as well) 
    #steps within a job are non independent & run on a single machine, must run in serial
    # at a minumum, steps require runs || uses, but having a name variable is good for organizing yourself
    steps:
      - name: hello-world #why his there a line in front of name but not ID? can we list multiple names or is it for this step? (diff between thsi and brances on triggers???)
        id: hello-world
        # when using run, you can update shell -> by default is current runner shell but you can specify powershell, python shell, etc
        run: | # pipe!!!
          echo "Hello World!!!"
          hello_world="Hello World!!!"
          echo "value=${hello_world}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
